# Traffic Flow Analyzer for Hacktoberfest 2024

The *Traffic Flow Analyzer* is a deep learning-powered tool designed for real-time monitoring and analysis of vehicle traffic. Leveraging advanced object detection models, this project detects vehicles, tracks movement, and provides key insights such as traffic density, speed estimation, and congestion hotspots. This tool is ideal for urban planners, transport authorities, and smart city enthusiasts aiming to improve traffic management and road safety.

## ‚ùá Getting Started with Hacktoberfest

Hacktoberfest is an open-source celebration hosted by [DigitalOcean](https://hacktoberfest.com), encouraging contributions to projects like this. Follow the steps below to get started and make your contribution.

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

1. Fork this repository by clicking the "Fork" button on the top-right corner of this page.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine:

    bash
    git clone https://github.com/{your-username}/Smart-Traffic-Flow-Analyzer.git
    cd Smart-Traffic-Flow-Analyzer
    

3. Add the original repository as a remote to keep your fork updated:

    bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/The-Red-Wood-Lab/Smart-Traffic-Flow-Analyzer.git
    

4. Sync your fork with the upstream repository before making any changes:

    bash
    git fetch upstream
    git checkout main
    git merge upstream/main
    

## ‚ùá How to Contribute

We are focused on detecting traffic congestion in real-time or through image/video analysis. We encourage you to expand the functionality‚Äîyour creativity and new features are welcome!

To contribute:

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch:

    bash
    git checkout -b feature-branch
    

2. Make your changes, such as adding a new feature, improving the model, or fixing a bug. Once done, commit your changes:
